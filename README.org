* About

This app uses Google's geocode api for doing:
- Geocode search
- Reverse geocode search
- Calculate geometric distance between two points

* Replacing API key

It's possible to either put the key directly into =GOOGLE_GEOCODE_API_KEY= in =prospectiva/settings.py=, set an environment variable, or save it in =.env=.

For passing the env variables to the docker container, rename =.env_template= to =.env= and put the key there.

* Running the app

After replacing the API key, you can either run =python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000= or use docker with =docker-compose up --build=.
